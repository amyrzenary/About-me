Thank you for stopping by!

## About Me

I'm a data scientist with a strong interest in solving real-world problems, especially in the energy sector.  
I recently completed a two-year work-study program, working on **anomaly detection** in solar power plants â€” identifying events like `snowfall`, `derating`, and `hotspots` using a mix of rule-based logic, data visualization, and machine learning models.

My background combines **data engineering**, **machine learning**, and a hands-on approach to building **tools that matter** â€” from scraping and processing large-scale time series, to deploying interactive apps for expert validation.

Iâ€™m also exploring projects involving **natural language processing**, including an assistant that understands travel requests in French and finds optimal routes using graph algorithms and entity extraction.

Coding has become my way to build, learn, and share â€” and Iâ€™m always aiming to create something thoughtful, useful, or just fun.

## Technologies I work with

- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, PyTorch, spaCy, Dash)
- **Data Engineering** (APIs, Parquet, Pickle, S3, ETL pipelines)
- **Machine Learning** (SOM, Autoencoders, Isolation Forest, Random Forest)
- **NLP** (Regex, NER, BERT-based models, graph search)
- **Front-End Tools** (Dash, Blender scripting, BabylonJS for 3D projects)

## What I'm exploring next

- Using **LLMs** to enrich noisy real-world data  
- Learning more about **reinforcement learning** and its applications in decision systems  
- Building more **open and interpretable ML tools**
